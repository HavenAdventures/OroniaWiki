# Overview 
> Located in north west [Knarencian Empire](/Places/KnarencianEmpire) lies a city nestled toward the base of the [Rowbeline Mountains](). To its south east are rolling foothills that host farm lands. To the east sits the [Naiden Wildlands](), a mostly uncharted wilderness that is thick with tribes-folk and monsters. On the other side of the mountains is the [Kingdom of Inversia](), to which a trade route was established. Over the years the city has become a home to artisans, adventurers, and traders. It is now an import trade route and the knights there are not only charged with keeping the peace in the city, but also the continued flow of goods and services through the mountains. Lourinhem is the last respite for those who would venture through the mountains.
