# Description
Inversia is a coastal kingdom in the world of Oronia, known for its lush landscapes, rich culture, and bustling commerce. Its capital city, Ros, is a vibrant metropolis set against the backdrop of the vast ocean, with cobblestone streets, grand architecture, and a diverse populace. As the heart of the kingdom, Ros is a hub of political intrigue, trade, and adventure, attracting individuals from all corners of Oronia.

# Politics
Politically, Inversia is ruled by the wise King Arthel and the compassionate Queen Elara from their royal palace in Ros. While their reign has generally been beneficial, factions within the kingdom seek to challenge the status quo. The most notable of these is the Crimson Hand, a secretive organization that believes the monarchy has lost touch with the struggles of the common folk and aims to instigate a rebellion.
## Racial Dynamics
In terms of racial dynamics, Inversia is generally progressive and accepting of different races, with humans, elves, dwarves, and halflings living in relative harmony. However, tensions do exist. The city of Ros, in particular, harbors prejudice against the tieflings, who are often unjustly associated with the criminal underworld. Orcs and half-orcs, while not outrightly discriminated against, are often met with suspicion due to long-standing cultural stereotypes.
