# Description

A large collection of honey-colored buildings with ornate stonework surrounding a trade square. It serves as the primary trading post and marketplace for goods coming in and out of Ros. Its bustling square is filled with merchants haggling over prices, peddling everything from spices from distant lands to beautifully crafted local wares.
