# Info
First encountered on the outskirts of [Ros](/Places/Inversia/Ros) during quest: [The Golden Guardian's Task](/Quests/TheGoldenGuardiansTask)
# Behavior
The Half-Goblin Bandit Captain tactically commands the battlefield, using his "Command Allies" ability at the onset to maximize early strikes against vulnerable foes. He engages directly with his warhammer when enemies are distracted, aiming for key figures. When the tide of battle shifts, he employs "Tactical Withdraw" to reposition or escape, ensuring he can continue to lead effectively and safely. His combat style focuses on exploiting enemy weaknesses through strategic placement and decisive leadership.
