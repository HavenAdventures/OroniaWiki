# Outline
- **Introduction:** Sergeant Thoren Oakshield meets the party at the Golden Guardians' headquarters. He explains that a group of bandits has been terrorizing the outskirts of Ros, and the Guardians need additional forces to deal with the problem.

- **Combat Encounter:** The party tracks the bandits to their hideout in a forested area outside Ros. The bandits are on high alert, and the party must battle their way through. When cornered, the bandit captain unleashes the cave troll on the unsuspecting party.

    - [Half Goblin Bandit](/Monsters/HalfGoblinBandit) CR 2 - x5
    - [Half Goblin Bandit Captain](/Monsters/HalfGoblinBanditCaptain) CR 3 - x1
    - Domesticated Cave Troll CR 4 - x1
   
- **Treasure:** As a token of gratitude, Sergeant Oakshield rewards the party with a Golden Guardians' Badge (a gold badge worth 50gp that acts as proof of their affiliation with the Guardians) and a Potion of Healing for each party member.

The successful completion of this task improves the party's standing with the Golden Guardians and provides them with a contact within the faction. This adventure also introduces the party to the challenges of maintaining peace and order in and around the city of Ros.
